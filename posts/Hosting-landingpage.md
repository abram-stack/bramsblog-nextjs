Namaste..
Uuuh.. Finally, i just finished the winter semester which was pretty much exhausting. I've had this project from the University about Wireless Sensor Network, which to be honest quite challenging, how to build and connecting all the sensor using the Zigbee microcontroller, and at the end using the raspberry pi as server. Luckily with great team efforts we managed it!!

I've been meaning to post about my project in my last post, it will come out soon!!
Little sneek peak, we are going to create our backend application using node.js and InfluxDB as our database, since we are dealing with timeseries data, so every measurements that has been recorded will have the timestamp as their "unique" id.

Anyway, i have no more exams and modules left this semester, and i am still looking for my internship, soo wish me luck that i'll get it soon. Alright enought talking, now i am basically have more time which is... yeaah! making some side projects! !!
it's been quite sometime and i want to refresh again my HTML, CS and JS.

This landing page is built only with HTML, CS and JS, well very small JS code, we get the DOM and render it dynamically, so we can get nice and easy collapsible component.
I also use normalize.css which is some kind of css helper that helps to make it "normal" when create page from scratch

Well, the story goes on.. stay tune, as i will put some more details on it.
while you are here check the actual landing page that i already hosting it using netlify online, and for free by the way.. Credit to Mosh, well he is well known as Programming with Mosh, incredible teacher! I have learnt lot of programming, my computer science study journey from Mosh!
